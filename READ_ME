README for Opentrons Automation of whole genome Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) in single cells using opentron
These Scripts are designed to streamline the MDA protocol in an opentron.
The MDA protocol amplifies DNA from single cells for tasks like forensic analysis

PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION:
The MDA protocol consists of 3 stages. A sample preparation stage, a DNA amplification stage, and a purification stage.
Our team has automated the protocol with 4 scripts total due to the limited space in the opentron.

We have 2 Executable Scripts and 2 Simulation Scripts: 
1) The sample_prep script ran first automates the sample prep/MDA part of the protocol.
2) The dna_purification script ran second automates the purification protocol.


Notes: 
1) Make sure to calibrate the opentron
2) We did not use the correct temperature as the protocol since it took too long and we weren't actually using any reagents or enzymes.
3) We deleted the step for the single cell picking.
